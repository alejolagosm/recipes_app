# Forkify Web Application

A web application to search, create and store online recipes.

This was built as part of the 2021 JS Course, designed by Jonas Schmedtmann.

- It uses his API (https://forkify-api.herokuapp.com/api/v2/recipes/) to make GET and POST requests.
- It uses the MVC architecture for the Javascript files.
- It uses SASS for the styling (This was built by Jonas, not myself)
- Built to practice Asynchronous JS, OOP, Classes and several other modern ES6 features.
